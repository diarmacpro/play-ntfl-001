I've created a comprehensive project report that covers all aspects of the warehouse management system development. The report includes:

Key Sections:
* Executive Summary - High-level overview of achievements
* Detailed Development Phases - Step-by-step development process with code examples
* Technical Implementation - Architecture details and key code snippets
* Visual Documentation - Placeholder screenshots with descriptions
* Professional Presentation - Features, metrics, and challenges overcome

Highlights:
* Critical Bug Fix Documentation - Detailed explanation of the nested HTML highlighting issue and solution
* Technical Code Examples - Real implementation snippets showing Firebase integration, search functionality, and performance optimizations
* Professional Formatting - Executive summary, detailed sections, recommendations, and proper conclusion
* Visual Placeholders - Strategic screenshot placeholders with detailed descriptions for each major feature

The report demonstrates systematic development approach, technical problem-solving capabilities, and professional delivery of a complex warehouse management system with modern UI/UX and advanced search capabilities.
